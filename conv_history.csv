11848,maybe like 64 bits per second is enough,Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2017 7:36pm"

11851,check it out,Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2017 7:37pm"
11852,"instead of a few lame songs, my idea is we can input any song the player wants, convert it to a data structure then use an algorithm to determine all the ""beats"" and let the user tap tap away while listening to their favorite songs",Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2017 7:39pm"
11853,just imagine if we input Fire - BTS,Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2017 7:53pm"

11855,"Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a way to do it, weâ€™ll just have to research",Brian Li,"Oct 22, 2017 9:06pm"
11856,When should our goal be to have an app in the market,Brian Li,"Oct 22, 2017 9:06pm"

11858,the hard part rly is the first part,Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2017 10:28pm"

11874,r they op,Brian Li,"Oct 23, 2017 6:29pm"
11875,"after talking to him the idea is this: partition each second into 16 intervals. for each syllable, consider the interval its the loudest in (highest amplitude)",Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:30pm"
11876,"if it's the k'th interval, let the k th bit of a 16-bit binary string be 1",Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:30pm"

11881,those can be done separately tho right,Brian Li,"Oct 23, 2017 6:31pm"
11882,we should prob first get rid of all the sound waves,Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:32pm"
11883,so we're just left with the singing voice,Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:32pm"
11884,then convert those into bits,Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:32pm"
11885,"so the lyrics ""AN-GE-LA-SHA"" would be 1000100010001000 or something",Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:33pm"

11892,but i think imovie has this feature to isolate the singing voice,Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:38pm"
11893,if we can write an algorithm to convert each song into bits,Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:38pm"
11894,creating the game is doable,Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:39pm"
11895,each bit corresponds to a tap,Michael Sun,"Oct 23, 2017 6:39pm"
11896,"hm, but we need something to do the conversions",Brian Li,"Oct 23, 2017 6:40pm"

12145,lemme learn python,Michael Sun,"Nov 08, 2017 9:36pm"
12146,"like legit for a problem my <think of algo time, implementation, debugging> time is <t, 10t, 10t>",Michael Sun,"Nov 08, 2017 9:40pm"
12147,there was this div 2 E problem that i thought of the algorithm for in a minute and spent like 2 hours coding it and it still doesnt work,Michael Sun,"Nov 08, 2017 9:40pm"
12148,"classic math pro, cs beginner stuff",Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:41pm"
12149,you'll get the hang of it,Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:41pm"
12150,keep going with java/c++ tho,Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:41pm"
12151,python will fk u over later,Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:42pm"
12152,wait y,Michael Sun,"Nov 08, 2017 9:42pm"
12153,isnt it more efficient,Michael Sun,"Nov 08, 2017 9:42pm"
12154,it's slow,Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:42pm"
12155,is it enough for usaco tho,Michael Sun,"Nov 08, 2017 9:43pm"
12156,for bronze-gold yeah,Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:43pm"
12157,i dun feel like learning c++ cuz most colelges teach it from scratch when u get in,Michael Sun,"Nov 08, 2017 9:44pm"
12158,and java is just annoying af,Michael Sun,"Nov 08, 2017 9:44pm"
12159,python is fine for usaco,Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:52pm"
12160,i stick to java/c++ depending on type of problem,Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:52pm"
12161,speed requires c++,Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:52pm"
12162,but some things are easier in java,Brian Li,"Nov 08, 2017 9:53pm"
12163,import java.util.*; import java.io.*;  public class Chores {     private static int n;     private static int k;     private static int x;     private static int[] arr;     private static int counter;      public static void main(String args[])     {         Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);         arr = new int[n];         n = in.nextInt();         k = in.nextInt();         x = in.nextInt();         counter = 0;          for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++)         {             arr[i] = in.nextInt();         }          Arrays.sort(arr);          for(int i=0; i<k; i++){             arr[i] = x;         }          for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++)         {             counter += arr[i];         }          System.out.println(counter);     }  },Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 1:30am"
12164,"also i see what u mean by speed, my java sol to this problem exceeded time and i hav no idea how to fix it rip",Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 3:14am"
12165,bruh i think we can make a rly good team,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 4:24am"
12166,"second sem when we make an app, i can develop the core algorithms while u  implement and test them (i can do some as well, but im trash both speed wise and bug wise)",Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 4:26am"
12167,Sounds like a plan ğŸ‘�,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 5:03am"
12168,"My goal is to be able to comfortably afford a supercar by the end of college, just as like a side goal to the big scheme of things",Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 5:18am"
12169,goals af,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 5:52am"
12170,mine is to become an amateur solo rapper/artist,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 5:54am"
12171,Littt,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 7:28am"
12172,ugh ive been stuck on this time exceeded on test case 6 for like an hour,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 8:40am"
12173,fml,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 8:40am"
12174,RAGEQUIT1!1!1!,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 8:58am"
12175,did u nest loops or something,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 10:56am"
12176,I did A-E on ecf32,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 12:53pm"
12177,Bruh fuck school i just want to start making apps and reeling in some income rn,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 12:54pm"
12178,Thatâ€™ll be my financial aid,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 12:54pm"
12179,"i think when we start out, we're gonna have to make several small apps to get experience, and then work on a major project",Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 2:57pm"
12180,well i had this app idea,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 6:05pm"
12181,basically its a countdown for anxious-waiting ppl,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 6:06pm"
12182,but time is represented as area of a shrinking object,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 6:06pm"
12183,"for ex. a pic of a ball shrinking is size, t proportional to r^2",Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 6:08pm"
12184,we can make it look pretty with javascript,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 6:08pm"
12185,Yeah something like that would be a dope start-off project,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 6:45pm"
12186,Where they can choose their shrinking object?,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 6:45pm"
12187,Or really any kind of animation thatâ€™s addicting to look at,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 6:46pm"
12188,"also we're gonna have to come up with a marketing strategy, so making the app will only be half of the race",Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 7:25pm"
12189,"true, but i doubt we can earn much money from this",Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:10pm"
12190,countdowns are lame and all over internet,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:10pm"
12191,"yeah, it'll be for experience mainly",Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:11pm"
12192,we gotta make it grpahically pleasing and rly rly unique,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:11pm"
12193,for sure,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:11pm"
12194,make it free for like a week and like 1 buck onwards,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:11pm"
12195,yeah,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:11pm"
12196,could we get ads,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:11pm"
12197,that's usually how to make bulk income,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:11pm"
12198,like flappy bird may 1 million+ a day off ads,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:12pm"
12199,prob not cuz its just a countdown timer lol,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:12pm"
12200,some games let u choose to watch ads to continue playing,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:12pm"
12201,thats good,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:12pm"
12202,"lol tru, yeah whatever this'll just be a trial project for us",Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:13pm"
12203,yeah,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:13pm"
12204,check out the game Dune on app store,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:14pm"
12205,something like that seems doable,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:14pm"
12206,yup,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:14pm"
12207,simple idea with nice visuals,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:14pm"
12208,finally solved EC32 C with arr[][],Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:22pm"
12209,"prev i used a nested for loop in a while loop, i think the trick for CF probs is use more data structures and less loops",Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:23pm"
12210,yup exactly,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:23pm"
12211,and for coding in general,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:23pm"
12212,like just look at the input constraints,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:23pm"
12213,and u can tell if u can nest or not,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:23pm"
12214,like big a$$ numbers?,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:25pm"
12215,whats a rule of thumb to how big they can be,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:25pm"
12216,like never nest if u see million,Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:27pm"
12217,"if u see 100, 1000, you will probably NEED to nest",Brian Li,"Nov 09, 2017 9:28pm"
12218,i c,Michael Sun,"Nov 09, 2017 9:29pm"
12219,bruh wanna team up to do online qualificiation round for HashCode this year,Michael Sun,"Nov 10, 2017 4:39am"
12220,looks hecka interesting,Michael Sun,"Nov 10, 2017 4:39am"
12221,Sounds good,Brian Li,"Nov 10, 2017 4:47am"
12222,Oh this is basically code jam except in teams,Brian Li,"Nov 10, 2017 4:48am"
12223,Like thereâ€™s qual round,Brian Li,"Nov 10, 2017 4:48am"
12224,oh,Michael Sun,"Nov 10, 2017 5:22am"

12229,"if we get deferred lets rage programming contests, we can add as addendum",Michael Sun,"Nov 10, 2017 8:39am"
12230,For sure,Brian Li,"Nov 10, 2017 9:28am"
12231,are you going to be in shanghai for the majority of this summer?,Brian Li,"Nov 11, 2017 9:06am"
12232,also apparently L&S CS is just as competitive as EECS nowadays...we should still be fine tho hopefully,Brian Li,"Nov 11, 2017 9:30am"
12233,likely,Michael Sun,"Nov 11, 2017 9:53am"
12234,"but im applying to Make school, maybe another developer program and perhaps an internship opportunity",Michael Sun,"Nov 11, 2017 9:54am"
12235,"also i listed my intended major as math, since u have time to declare ur major for l&s after u get there",Michael Sun,"Nov 11, 2017 9:58am"
12236,"supposedly l&s doesnt factor in intended major, but for cs it might cuz too much ppl",Michael Sun,"Nov 11, 2017 9:59am"
12237,but dw ppl who apply to cs rather than eecs arent as good so u'll be man among boys,Michael Sun,"Nov 11, 2017 9:59am"
12238,"ok dope bc im coming to shanghai this summer to visit and we could perhaps meet up if time allows and yeah, ill probably apply to make school/internship as well",Brian Li,"Nov 11, 2017 11:15am"
12239,"also, another good site is codefights which is kinda like a game except it hones ur skills and is good for software engineer interview practice",Brian Li,"Nov 11, 2017 11:22am"
12240,lezzgoo,Michael Sun,"Nov 11, 2017 5:33pm"
12241,its gna be lit,Michael Sun,"Nov 11, 2017 5:35pm"

12268,its too competitive here,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:16am"
12269,"i mean, colleges will realize u had to make some sacrifices to make usamo/isef",Brian Li,"Nov 12, 2017 9:18am"
12270,true,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:19am"
12271,"still, theres like 20-30 ppl applying to stanf early",Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:20am"
12272,"yeah but like in the long run, gpa is like 100x less impressive than usamo",Brian Li,"Nov 12, 2017 9:21am"
12273,hopefully,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:21am"
12274,i think i just need a distraction,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:21am"
12275,but then i dun rly feel motivation to do much until i get in,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:22am"
12276,just do some coding on the side,Brian Li,"Nov 12, 2017 9:22am"
12277,learn some new things that interest you,Brian Li,"Nov 12, 2017 9:22am"
12278,yea im gna try to make it a routine to solve a div2 problem every morning,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:24am"
12279,the thing about doing coding probs is its not rly fulfilling,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:24am"
12280,its like math comps all over again,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:24am"
12281,yeah so that's where the application of coding comes in,Brian Li,"Nov 12, 2017 9:25am"
12282,unfortunately i cant rlly accompany u on that until i finish all my apps and get through midterms,Brian Li,"Nov 12, 2017 9:25am"
12283,yea hopefully,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:32am"
12284,im gna learn some AI stuff on coursera,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:32am"
12285,like learning to code a neural network so we can make a mini alpha-go that can do certain tasks,Michael Sun,"Nov 12, 2017 9:33am"
12286,that's dope,Brian Li,"Nov 12, 2017 9:33am"

14225,Oof time to break this girlâ€™s heart?,Brian Li,"Jun 17, 2018 8:47am"
14226,"â€œFirst of all, I believe fostering a warm-hearted connection is necessary for a deep friendship, which seems to be where weâ€™re headed â€” and hugs in my opinion is entirely felicitous. Second of all, as I said, the physical contact I give always reflects the status of the relationship, so making out as friends would be inappropriate, unless it is a friend with benefits you desire in me, which Iâ€™ll sadly have to reject. I know I mentioned once I like you, but further analysis (esp. after first date) I recall articles on how INFJs and INTJsâ€™ Ni commonality with Te and Fe contrasts allow them to connect and learn from each other on a deep level (oftentimes making great companionships), and that is what I see the best in you. Subjugating that with superficial sensory experiences is not right. I always want the best for the ppl important to me, so Iâ€™ll say weâ€™re rly not the right pair. Iâ€™m grateful for your affection, and turning down girls respectfully is always hard. Thatâ€™s why I can happily accommodate you on additional dates as to protect your affection (unless you think itâ€™ll aggravate the problem), but certain lines canâ€™t be crossed. Iâ€™ve been in your position many times before, so Iâ€™ll let you have time to figure things out â€” if youâ€™d like to call off movie night, find time to talk, move on as friends like this conversation never happened, just let me know and Iâ€™m all down. Hope youâ€™ll feel better, we both have great futures ahead and I just hope our relationship heads down a productive rather than a destructive path.â€�",Michael Sun,"Jun 17, 2018 10:18am"

15437,I love her and I know she loves me,Michael Sun,"Oct 19, 2018 11:03am"
15438,Itâ€™s just that we have diff expectations and are too stubborn to compromise,Michael Sun,"Oct 19, 2018 11:04am"
15439,What isnâ€™t acceptable to me seems so nonchalant with her and vice versa - her committed to working with boys on her floor on something that sucks rather than with me,Michael Sun,"Oct 19, 2018 11:05am"
15440,"Yeah it sucks bro, but you gotta do what you gotta do and both of you will move on eventually.",Brian Li,"Oct 19, 2018 12:46pm"
15441,"It feels terrible at first, but it's for the better good, ultimately",Brian Li,"Oct 19, 2018 12:46pm"

15443,I know we still love each other,Michael Sun,"Oct 19, 2018 1:54pm"
15444,What should two ppl who love each other but are fundamentally incompatible do,Michael Sun,"Oct 19, 2018 1:54pm"
15445,Thatâ€™s the question,Michael Sun,"Oct 19, 2018 1:54pm"
15446,Bruh,Michael Sun,"Oct 19, 2018 5:24pm"
15447,We got back together,Michael Sun,"Oct 19, 2018 5:24pm"

15453,The bitch clings to those two boys sheâ€™s doing the project with for deal life,Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2018 12:42am"
15454,Saying how it means so much to her even tho the project idea is shit and I expressed extreme discomfort over it,Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2018 12:43am"
15455,Those two boys on her floor,Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2018 12:43am"
15456,"Bruh, if you break up you gotta break up and be strangers again",Brian Li,"Oct 22, 2018 8:08am"
15457,Sheâ€™s clearly just draining you,Brian Li,"Oct 22, 2018 8:08am"
15458,You gotta be done with it forever,Brian Li,"Oct 22, 2018 8:09am"
15459,Bruh idk man,Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2018 7:34pm"
15460,Iâ€™m gna rage channel it into work,Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2018 7:35pm"
15461,"Benched 4 reps on 50 each side today, p happy",Michael Sun,"Oct 22, 2018 7:35pm"
15462,Guess what,Michael Sun,"Oct 24, 2018 4:03am"
15463,We got back together again,Michael Sun,"Oct 24, 2018 4:04am"
15464,And on p good terms,Michael Sun,"Oct 24, 2018 4:04am"
15465,I think we got so exhausted being mad at each other that we're chill again,Michael Sun,"Oct 24, 2018 4:05am"
15466,Also added you to aiFood beta test group; you should actually try it as if you gonna use it and give feedback,Michael Sun,"Oct 24, 2018 4:09am"
15467,"Alright man, as long as itâ€™s a healthier relationship niw",Brian Li,"Oct 24, 2018 5:36am"
15468,"But yes I sure will, i actually kinda need something like that rn",Brian Li,"Oct 24, 2018 5:36am"
15469,Bruh,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 1:50pm"
15470,"Bro im sorry i didnt get to it yet, i just had 3 exams these past few days, I promise on my life i will test it tonight",Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 4:00pm"
15471,Yo no worries,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 4:33pm"
15472,I actually really like this app,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 7:18pm"
15473,Like itâ€™s good for people who donâ€™t want to put in too much effort planning,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 7:18pm"
15474,Maybe you could give details on what numbers you would want to input in order to lose specific amount of weight or gain specific amount of muscle over a specific amount of time,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 7:20pm"
15475,Yea I was thinking that,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 7:55pm"
15476,But one route forward is partnering with a YouTube celebrity like Big Brandon Carter,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 7:55pm"
15477,And basically have an exclusive partnership,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 7:55pm"
15478,The terms of which is I can customize the app however best supports the dudeâ€™s business,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 7:56pm"
15479,I get some leverage since these YouTube celebrities are all competing with each other,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 7:57pm"
15480,And I get a 5% royalty for every new client that he brings in as return for the exclusive nature of the partnership,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 7:58pm"
15481,Iâ€™m looking at BBC cause he seems the most business-y lol,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 7:59pm"
15482,Tho thereâ€™re many other bodybuilder businesses on YouTube for which my app can give their business an edge,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:00pm"
15483,5 bucks for every client user for like a 2 year contract is prob p good,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:01pm"
15484,Brian: ó°€€,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:06pm"
15485,For sure,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:06pm"
15486,Hmm ill try to come up with more ideas to expand,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:07pm"
15487,Bruh can I ask a possible favor,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:07pm"
15488,Yeah go for it,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:14pm"
15489,How strong do you think your sale skills are,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:19pm"
15490,Im a good persuader and i am eager to learn,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:20pm"
15491,This does really fascinate me,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:21pm"
15492,So ill def put lots of effort into it,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:21pm"
15493,If you let me,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:21pm"
15494,Emailing all the YouTube ppl; calling them and negotiating deals is not exactly up my alley,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:30pm"
15495,And also going to like all the online bodybuilding forums and asking the moderators to spread the app,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:31pm"
15496,And instagram/facebook groups,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:31pm"
15497,I def need someone to spend the time to do that haha,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:33pm"
15498,I wanted to do all that myself but sigh my time is too limited,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:34pm"
15499,If you're rly up the task of helping out I can split you 5% of whatever revenue the app makes,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:37pm"
15500,*of whatever revenue the app makes from a deal you nail,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:38pm"
15501,I can start by helping you market and spread,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:38pm"
15502,And at the same time learn negotiation skills,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:39pm"
15503,"Then if things go well and stuff, you can decide if I deserve any revenue",Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:39pm"
15504,Respect lol,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:40pm"
15505,That'll be amazing,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:40pm"
15506,"And for sure, if you're like bringing in 500% more sales than had I done it myself I'll def split you a major portion of that",Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:40pm"
15507,Brian: ó°€€,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:40pm"
15508,Im excited,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:40pm"
15509,Yes man,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:41pm"
15510,Let's do this,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:41pm"
15511,good shit,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:41pm"
15512,Gonna start with bodybuilding forums,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:41pm"
15513,do you have like a document where there's a good description of the app?,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:42pm"
15514,Description will be on the App Store,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:42pm"
15515,Don't start spreading until v1 is on the App Store lol,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:42pm"
15516,yeah for sure,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:42pm"

15519,There're so many social media blogs/channels/insta's/groups/sites,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:43pm"
15520,yeah i actually used to use a lot of them,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:43pm"

15523,You: ó°€€,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:44pm"
15524,I'll grind out v1 by this weekend,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:44pm"
15525,So you can start spreading p soon,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:44pm"
15526,im not too busy next week,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:45pm"
15527,This is so exciting,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:46pm"
15528,The best case scenario is we get good usage amount and get acquired,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:47pm"
15529,*Sells aiFood to MyFitnessPal for 10 million,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:48pm"
15530,bro,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:48pm"
15531,And worst case scenario is we fail but learn a lot,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:48pm"
15532,"yeah, so ultimately this is beneficial",Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:48pm"
15533,jesus :O,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:49pm"
15534,also im looking at app review websties too,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:49pm"
15535,those can help a lot if successful,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:50pm"
15536,Right,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:50pm"
15537,I wanna focus on bodybuilders first,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:51pm"
15538,yeah true,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:51pm"
15539,Based on my knowledge bodybuilders macro-count in the most tedious way,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:51pm"
15540,That is add stuff up,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:51pm"
15541,Or meal-plan the same rotation of meals for the upcoming weeks,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:52pm"
15542,If we can get all the bodybuilders on aiFood permanently,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:52pm"
15543,That's already a p large user-base,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:53pm"
15544,yeah i think this would be good for sure,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:55pm"
15545,hmm,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:55pm"
15546,im thinking of ways to really get people's attention,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:55pm"
15547,bodybuilding.com forums are hugee,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:56pm"
15548,need to think of a way to make sure a post isnt overlooked,Brian Li,"Oct 25, 2018 8:56pm"
15549,Yea,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:58pm"
15550,Prob just contact the moderators to make a thread?,Michael Sun,"Oct 25, 2018 8:59pm"
15551,Aight cool,Brian Li,"Oct 26, 2018 9:20pm"
15552,Iâ€™ll be a bit busy these next two days but def grinding starting sunday night/monday,Brian Li,"Oct 26, 2018 9:20pm"
15553,Bruh no worries; don't do it for me as a friend; do it genuinely cuz you believe in the app and all the ppl out there that the app can help,Michael Sun,"Oct 26, 2018 9:43pm"
15554,This marketing tho,Michael Sun,"Oct 27, 2018 1:38am"
15555,You sent a photo.,Michael Sun,"Oct 27, 2018 1:38am"
15556,I definitely like this app,Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 5:04pm"
15557,and think it could become something great,Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 5:05pm"
15558,but ikr that kind of marketing is so interesting,Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 5:05pm"
15559,"also for the app i think you can expand more on the food stuff. Like for each, explain different ways of preparation and maybe even include links to cooking websites",Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 5:05pm"
15560,but i guess at the same time that might bring in other unwanted ingredients,Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 5:06pm"
15561,Yea I def considered those,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:06pm"
15562,But the main prob is theyâ€™re hard to implement and I have little time and no money to hire ppl lol,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:06pm"
15563,"And secondly it brings focus away from the unique value for the app, which is a widget like app targeted specifically at bodybuilders to automate macro counting",Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:07pm"
15564,Which is a smaller and easier market to target at the start,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:07pm"
15565,alright gotcha that makes sense,Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 5:08pm"
15566,But ofc once it has a stable user base Iâ€™ll look to add more features,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:08pm"
15567,"right, so first we need to make sure the are a decent number of users",Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 5:09pm"
15568,i got an email about the new version,Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 5:09pm"
15569,Tmr will be a newer beta,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:16pm"
15570,With popovers walking users thru how to use it and with ability to load prev. saved lists and also better UI,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:16pm"
15571,Goal was to publish today but sigh life,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:17pm"
15572,Also I wanna ask you your thought,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:24pm"
15573,What percentage of bodybuilders do you think know at least one other bodybuilder,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:24pm"
15574,*at least two other bodybuilders,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:24pm"
15575,Iâ€™m considering having a payment method where you ether pay a buck to get full access or get it free by getting another bodybuilder on the platform via an unique referral code,Michael Sun,"Oct 28, 2018 5:27pm"
15576,Usually bodybuilders meet others through gyms or got started with bodybuilding in the first place because of someone else,Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 6:12pm"
15577,so I think that would be a good idea for sure,Brian Li,"Oct 28, 2018 6:12pm"
15578,^^,Michael Sun,"Oct 29, 2018 1:34am"
15579,Would it surprise you that Gillian proposed breaking up again yesterday and cried for hours,Michael Sun,"Oct 29, 2018 1:34am"
15580,Then today weâ€™re good again,Michael Sun,"Oct 29, 2018 1:35am"
15581,"i feel you, been there bro",Brian Li,"Oct 29, 2018 8:59am"
15582,every day is something different,Brian Li,"Oct 29, 2018 8:59am"
15583,we gotta focus on the app tho man,Brian Li,"Oct 29, 2018 8:59am"
15584,Bruh man,Michael Sun,"Oct 29, 2018 2:56pm"
15585,what's up?,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 8:49am"
15586,haha i noticed your easter egg,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 9:55am"
15587,try bolding or coloring the Register now for free text,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 9:55am"
15588,that's the hook,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 9:55am"
15589,or like the main thing you want users to see,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 9:56am"
15590,"also when the time is ready, ill create fb, ig pages for the app and also try to market it on targeted youtube channels",Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 1:01pm"
15591,as well as ofc bodybuilding sites and forums,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 1:02pm"
15592,"Lol that Easter egg was long overdue, none of the stuff described have been implemented",Michael Sun,"Oct 30, 2018 1:05pm"
15593,Itâ€™ll be ready by the end of the week hopefully,Michael Sun,"Oct 30, 2018 1:05pm"
15594,Brian: ó°€€,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 1:12pm"
15595,Iâ€™m so flanked by everything Iâ€™ve committed to,Michael Sun,"Oct 30, 2018 1:13pm"
15596,So idk when itâ€™ll be ready,Michael Sun,"Oct 30, 2018 1:14pm"
15597,But once it is you can go ham on the marketing,Michael Sun,"Oct 30, 2018 1:14pm"
15598,Iâ€™ll entrust you to do it - sadly itâ€™s likely I wonâ€™t have time to do it with u,Michael Sun,"Oct 30, 2018 1:15pm"
15599,"it's fine man, i understand, we're both busy with school on top of this",Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 2:12pm"
15600,yo bro can you send me a pic of the app logo,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 2:47pm"

15602,Yea will do,Michael Sun,"Oct 30, 2018 3:30pm"
15603,Brian: ó°€€,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 3:53pm"
15604,fb is pretty good platform for marketing ive realized,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 3:54pm"
15605,You sent a photo.,Michael Sun,"Oct 30, 2018 6:11pm"
15606,alright how does it look,Brian Li,"Oct 30, 2018 6:21pm"
15607,Pic looks good,Michael Sun,"Oct 30, 2018 7:24pm"
15608,Yo,Michael Sun,"Oct 31, 2018 6:05pm"
15609,"Just had a talk with a Med School PhD, who used to do healthcare startups",Michael Sun,"Oct 31, 2018 6:05pm"
15610,He showed me a lotta existing fitness/nutrition/food solutions like Azumio (whose CTO he knows personally) that's like 100x more scaled than us and 10x better engineered,Michael Sun,"Oct 31, 2018 6:06pm"
15611,Made me realize we rly rly have to focus on that niche of bodybuilders and customize the app to fit them,Michael Sun,"Oct 31, 2018 6:06pm"
15612,Otherwise we're fighting a losing match,Michael Sun,"Oct 31, 2018 6:07pm"
15613,I might rename the app to aiMacros,Michael Sun,"Oct 31, 2018 6:08pm"
15614,Brian: ó°€€,Brian Li,"Oct 31, 2018 7:07pm"
15615,"gotcha bro, glad you had that talk",Brian Li,"Oct 31, 2018 7:07pm"
15616,did he like the idea?,Brian Li,"Oct 31, 2018 7:07pm"
15617,"He def was impressed, tho he constructively criticized me for not focusing on a specific target segment, i.e. he advised I pivot aiRoute to focus on providing analytics for athletes/pro-runners beginning at Stanford, and aiFood to integrate with Stanford dining halls. He introduced umber of backup options if these apps fail to grow organically, like integrating aiRoute to a current Stanford motion-health project that's in early stage.",Michael Sun,"Oct 31, 2018 9:46pm"
15618,Brian: ó°€€,Brian Li,"Oct 31, 2018 9:47pm"
15619,"I think that's what I might do with aiRoute, but aiFood (aiMacro) I want us to try hard growing organically - we can learn a lot from this.",Michael Sun,"Oct 31, 2018 9:47pm"
15620,"Sounds good, but yeah I wanna work hard on growing it",Brian Li,"Oct 31, 2018 9:53pm"
15621,And this could pave a good path for us,Brian Li,"Oct 31, 2018 9:53pm"
15622,Bruh,Michael Sun,"Nov 01, 2018 5:46pm"
15623,Iâ€™m submitting v1 tonight,Michael Sun,"Nov 01, 2018 5:47pm"
